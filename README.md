# slush-hapi-service
Slush generator for creating the foundation of a HapiJS service/webapp. With the original GEUT style.

___

## Install

```bash 
$ npm i -g slush-hap√≠-service
```

## Usage

Create your project folder:
```bash 
mkdir my_hapi_service && cd my_hapi_service
```

And then, run the slush generator inside your project folder:
```bash 
slush hapi-service
```

That's all. The generator will ask some questions, like if you are using a prefix for your projects (scopes are better, but you know).

:D
